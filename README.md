# eCDP-rpc
Thanks For Using my Rich Presence GUI for eCDP!

1. Run "pre-inst.bat" before using it!
2. You will need a Python install for this! Get em' here! - https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. You can run it using many ways, but I recommend using the Windows Terminal. (wt.exe)
4. If you have troubles with the Rich Presence, DM or ping me on Discord (ImPurpl3#0871)
